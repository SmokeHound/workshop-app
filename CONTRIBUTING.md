# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to contribute! A few guidelines to get started:

- Fork the repository and create feature branches for PRs.
- Run `npm install` and any required build steps before making changes.
- Run tests and linters (if present) before opening a PR.
- Keep PRs focused and include a clear description of the change.
- For security issues, see `SECURITY.md` and contact the maintainers privately.
